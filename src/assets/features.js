    description: 'The most notable difference compared to the rest of the S22 line is the lack of a camera "island" surrounding the rear-facing cameras. While it does alienate the S22 Ultra from the rest of the range, it ties in with the minimalist design, with small details like polished metal housing around the cameras contributing to the high-end look.',

Samsung claims at standard levels it can reach up to 1250nits, while a boosted brightness mode (ideal for outdoor use) cranks it up to an even higher 1750 nits.',

    description: "Many regarded the Galaxy S21 Ultra's camera setup as the best in the market in 2021, and it seems Samsung agreed because the sensors on the rear of the phone are almost identical to its predecessor. The S22 Ultra has the same 108Mp main wide lens, 12Mp 120-degree ultrawide and dual telephoto lenses offering 3x and 10x optical zoom on the rear, with the latter capable of extending to 100x, and a 40Mp selfie camera on the front.",
    specs: [
      'One of the best rear camera setups around',
      'Big improvements to the 100x space zoom',
      'Great low-light performance'
